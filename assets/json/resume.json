Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of CTRL remains limited, especially in settings with general function approximation. In this work, we propose a model-based CTRL algorithm that achieves both sample and computational efficiency. Moreover, we introduce structured policy updates and an alternative measurement strategy that significantly reduce the number of policy updates and rollouts while maintaining competitive sample efficiency. Our proposed algorithms are validated through experiments on continuous control tasks and diffusion model fine-tuning, demonstrating comparable performance with significantly fewer policy updates and rollouts.",
